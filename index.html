					<p>About Me</p>
					<p>Develop & Designer</p>
					<p>My name is Le Thi Doan Hau. I’m 20 years old. I live in Ho Chi Minh city and have just graduated from X university in August with the major in fashion design. I’ve got 3 months experience as an intern at A company. I like reading books and cooking. I’m a careful and hard-working person. I’m eager to learn new things and willing to work in team. I easily adapt to new working environment and take initiative in work. </p>
					<p>I’m an active person who enjoy  working in the fields related to human beings. I’m rather serious and sensitive, so I can quickly catch up with the psychology of other people. I often read newspapers and listen to music in my free time.</p>
